        <h2>   
              <br>I have been practicing traditional Indian singing for about 7 years now, and it has truly been an enriching and enjoyable journey. 
              <br>Over the years, I've developed a deep appreciation for the intricate techniques and unique rhythms of Indian classical music. 
              <br>It's not only been a fun hobby but also a way for me to connect with my cultural roots and express emotions through music.
              <br>Every practice session offers something new to learn, whether it's mastering a particular raga or experimenting with different vocal nuances.
              <br>The process has brought me a sense of calm and fulfillment,  and I'm excited to continue exploring this beautiful art form.
